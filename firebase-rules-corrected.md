# Corrected Firebase Rules

## Realtime Database Rules (No changes needed)
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "users": {
      "$uid": {
        ".read": "auth != null && auth.uid == $uid",
        ".write": "auth != null && auth.uid == $uid"
      }
    },
    "adminContent": {
      ".read": "auth != null && auth.token.isAdmin === true",
      ".write": "auth != null && auth.token.isAdmin === true"
    }
  }
}
```

## Firestore Database Rules (CORRECTED)
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can read, update, delete their own user document
    match /users/{userId} {
      // Fixed: Users can only create their own user document
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow read, update, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Admin-specific collections are only accessible to admins
    match /adminData/{docId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.token.isAdmin == true;
    }
  }
}
```

## Key Security Fix
The issue was that the original `allow create` rule:
```javascript
allow create: if request.auth != null;
```

This allowed ANY authenticated user to create a user document with ANY userId, which is a security vulnerability.

The corrected rule ensures:
```javascript
allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
```

Now users can ONLY create their own user document, matching their authentication uid.
